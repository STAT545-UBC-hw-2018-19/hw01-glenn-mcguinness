# STAT 545A - Homework 1

This repository contains homework 1 for STAT 545A, offered at UBC September-October 2018. The purpose of this assignment is to test out markdown, particulrly Github-flavoured markdown, features.

In this README, I will explore some of these Markdown features while introducing myself. The formatting is done for it's own sake, so it may not quite fit the text.

## Myself
### Hometown
I am from *Maple Ridge*, a suburb of __Vancouver__. I moved from Maple Ridge to Vancouver to do my undergraduate degree *at __UBC__*. While Vancouver is \*very\* rainy, I find the weather generally pleasant.

## Education
![UBC Vancouver Campus](./ubc.jpeg)
I did my undergraduate degree at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Engineering Physics. However, I did not go into Engineering Physics at first. I went into the following programs, before settling on Engineering Physics:
1. First year science
2. First year engineering
3. Computer Engineering \(very briefly\)
4. Engineering Physics
It was in Engineering Physics I learned to appreciate unnecessary lists. I also learned one other thing.
> Block quotes appear very authoratative.
I am now in a masters of statistics at UBC.

## Work
For the past year I, @glenn-mcguinness, worked as a software developer, primarily in C++.
```C++
void example::Function(bool arg)
{
    printf("Where I wrote code like this.");
}
```
## Miscellaneous
Here, I will try out features for their own sake :+1:.
